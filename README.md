## Description.
Cocker Drive is a file manager web. <br><br> Purpose of this project is to have a versatile file manager in terms of phisic storage place, could be *your own pc, a home server, NAS or servers more powerfull like AWS*. This project contribute the  programming logic, physical storage place is your choise.

Later I will add in the documentation (README) the different configurations according to the physical storage place you can use, currently I have only written localhost storage system way.

# To consider .. :

This web aplication contains  uploaded files such as icon of web, images as icons of different types of files

<hr>

# php.ini file configuration server  *( example configuration, feel free to adjust it to your needs)*

> post_max_size = 2048M <br>
upload_max_filesize = 2048M  <br>
max_execution_time = 5000  <br>
max_input_time = 5000  <br>
memory_limit = 2048M  <br>
max_file_uploads= 500 <br>

# Future thoughts


+ Fichero class will change. With a class inheritance system i will optimize and clarify code. This feature will improve reading and it will get modularity in order to reuse code. (Working right now !)

<hr>

+ Tests for correct working of application.
+ Labeling system for each user file. (like twitter)
+ Temporal urls for sharing and another uses.

Those changes will produce an improving of code reading and comprehension.
