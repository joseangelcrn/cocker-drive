# Future thoughts

### Visual 

- Labeling system for each file. (like twitter)
- Temporal urls for sharing and another uses.

### About code

+ Fichero Class will be splited in two files:
  - FileBinManager: Refering to bin part of files (Uploading, deleting, etc..).
  - FileDataManager: Refering to storaged data on database about file information (Extension, created_at, real_name, hash_name,etc..).

Those changes will produce an improving of code reading and comprehension
